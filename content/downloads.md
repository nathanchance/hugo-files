I used to host files on this website but I have offloaded them to other services.

Flash Kernel downloads can be found in their individual repos:

* [Nexus 6P](https://github.com/nathanchance/angler/releases)
* [OnePlus 5](https://github.com/nathanchance/op5/releases)
* [OnePlus 6](https://github.com/nathanchance/op6/releases)
* [Pixel (XL)](https://github.com/nathanchance/marlin/releases)
* [Pixel 2 (XL)](https://github.com/nathanchance/wahoo/releases)

Note, these are all unmaintained right now so I wouldn't recommend running them in their current form but it's your device.

TWRP downloads can be found in the threads that referenced them:

* [Nexus 6](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/development/rom-vanilla-rootless-oms-f2fs-t3575979)
* [Nexus 6P](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/development/unofficial-twrp-3-0-3-x-f2fs-support-t3543450)

Anything else wasn't important enough to mention here. I've updated the links in all the places I could. Contact me using the info on the front page if you need something that isn't here.
