All of my personal projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathanchance), here are a few key repositories that I am proud of:

* [Flash Kernel for the Pixel 2 (XL)](https://github.com/nathanchance/wahoo) - Some of the highlights include merging linux-stable, adding optimization patches and bug fixes from CAF, and adding kernel/common improvements such as EAS 1.4.
* [Flash Kernel for the OnePlus 5](https://github.com/nathanchance/op5) - Some highlights include merging linux-stable, staying up to date with the latest CAF tag, and being the only kernel compiled with Clang.
* [My scripts](https://github.com/nathanchance/scripts) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/nathanchance/dotfiles) - The scripts I use for my workflow and personal configuration files.
* [build-tools-gcc](https://github.com/nathanchance/build-tools-gcc) - A script to build a GCC cross compiler for arm/arm64.
* [pixel2-manifest](https://github.com/nathanchance/pixel2-manifest) - A minimal manifest for building Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL boot images.

Additionally, I am a part of the following projects:

* [android-linux-stable](https://github.com/android-linux-stable) - A few Android kernel trees with the latest stable tags from [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org) merged into them, along with conflict resolution notes and a how-to process for other developers and information for users to understand the process.
* [Substratum](https://github.com/substratum) - An app to compile theming overlays for Sony's Overlay Manager Service (OMS). I am responsible for [our code review](https://substratum.review]) and [our documentation](https://github.com/substratum/documentation).
* [Dirty Unicorns](https://github.com/DirtyUnicorns) - An aftermarket Android ROM. I am responsible for helping with testing and picking in features, along with fixing issues.
